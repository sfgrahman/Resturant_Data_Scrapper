Restaurant Data scrapping from [yelp.com](https://www.yelp.com/)

Note:
Scraping Yelp without using browser automation tools like Selenium can be done by making HTTP requests directly to the Yelp website and then parsing the HTML content. However, please note that web scraping can violate Yelp's Terms of Service. Make sure you review and adhere to Yelp's API Terms of Service and robots.txt file before scraping their site.
